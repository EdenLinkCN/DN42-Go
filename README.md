# DN42-Deploy
Give servers a config for joining DN42.

Now i have 4 nodes waiting for join DN42. 

Why? Because "someone" suggest me to config my IGP before peer with others

then i **REINSTALL** system on it.

Well i use Ubuntu 20.04(.3) on my server and i dont want to config every server **MANUALLY**

so i spend sometime to write it .

Just it.
